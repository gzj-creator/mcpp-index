-- compat.harfbuzz — HarfBuzz text shaping engine, with the FreeType font backend.
--
-- Shape A (C-source compat, C++ flavour): the user writes `#include <hb.h>`
-- and, for the FreeType bridge, `#include <hb-ft.h>`.
--
-- ONE TRANSLATION UNIT, ON PURPOSE.
-- Upstream builds with meson (or a CMake port), and reproducing either here
-- would mean tracking ~137 .cc files plus their generated config. HarfBuzz
-- ships `src/harfbuzz.cc` for exactly this case: an amalgamation that
-- #includes every implementation file. It is upstream's own supported
-- "just compile one file" path, so the source list stays one line and cannot
-- drift out of sync with a release.
--
-- The amalgamation also #includes the backends this package does not enable
-- (CoreText, DirectWrite, GDI, GLib, Graphite2, ICU). Each of those is behind
-- its own HAVE_* gate and compiles to nothing when the gate is absent, so
-- naming only HAVE_FREETYPE selects precisely the FreeType backend without
-- editing anything.
--
-- NO config.h. HarfBuzz reads one only under HAVE_CONFIG_H, which is not
-- defined here; `hb-config.hh` then supplies the defaults. That is what keeps
-- this a source-only package with no configure step.
--
-- HB_NO_MT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SET. It drops HarfBuzz's atomics and locks,
-- which is only sound when the consumer guarantees single-threaded use --
-- a promise a shared index package cannot make on its consumers' behalf.
