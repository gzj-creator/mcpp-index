-- compat.concurrentqueue — moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue 1.0.5, Cameron
-- Desrochers' lock-free multi-producer/multi-consumer queue, plus its blocking
-- sibling (BlockingConcurrentQueue, on top of a lightweight semaphore) and the
-- flat C API over both.
--
-- Shape B (header-only), same as compat.gtl / compat.plf-hive: the entire
-- library is `concurrentqueue.h`, `blockingconcurrentqueue.h` and
-- `lightweightsemaphore.h` at the TARBALL ROOT, so `include_dirs = {"*"}` (the
-- `*` absorbs the archive's `concurrentqueue-<ver>/` wrap layer) and a trivial
-- anchor TU are the whole package. Consumers write `#include
-- <concurrentqueue.h>` exactly as upstream's README shows. On Linux the
-- blocking queue's semaphore is POSIX `sem_t` (`<semaphore.h>`), so nothing
-- beyond a C++ compiler is needed — no `_GNU_SOURCE`, no -lpthread dance of
-- its own.
--
-- The one genuinely optional COMPILABLE piece is `c_api/` — two .cpp TUs that
-- wrap the queues behind an `extern "C"` surface
-- (moodycamel_cq_create/enqueue/…). That is exactly the sources-only gate the
-- feature table is for (the compat.cjson `utils` precedent), and it is OFF by
-- default: a consumer that only wants the C++ header does not pay for two
-- TUs. Everything else that upstream leaves out of its library target is
-- header-only (nothing to gate) or carries its own main()/benchmarks (a lib
-- target's objects enter the consumer's link eagerly, so a main() shipped in
-- a package collides with the consumer's — the compat.libaio reasoning).
--
-- WINDOWS AND THE C API. `c_api/concurrentqueue.h` picks its `MOODYCAMEL_EXPORT`
-- spelling on its own: without MOODYCAMEL_STATIC or DLL_EXPORT it assumes a
-- DLL client and declares every function `__declspec(dllimport)`, which is
-- wrong twice here — the package's own .cpp would DEFINE a dllimport function,
-- and a static-archive consumer would try to import what it is about to link.
-- So this package declares MOODYCAMEL_STATIC for both sides: `cxxflags` covers
-- the package's TUs (all two of them are C++; `cflags` would never reach them
-- — the compat.msdfgen lesson), and the feature's `defines` (Feature System
-- v2) covers the consumer's. The macro is only read inside `#ifdef _WIN32`, so
-- defining it unconditionally is inert on linux/macos.
