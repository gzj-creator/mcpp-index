-- Form B inline descriptor for miniaudio — a single-file audio playback and
-- capture library that wraps every platform's native backend (WASAPI/DirectSound/
-- WinMM, Core Audio, ALSA/PulseAudio/JACK, OSS, AAudio/OpenSL, Web Audio) behind
-- one API, plus decoding for WAV/FLAC/MP3 and a mixing/resampling engine.
--
-- SHAPE: header-only WITH an upstream-supplied implementation TU. `miniaudio.h`
-- carries both the declarations and, behind MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION, the whole
-- implementation; `miniaudio.c` at the tarball root is upstream's own two-line
-- driver for it:
--
--     #define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
--     #include "miniaudio.h"
--
-- Compiling that file here is what makes this a linkable package rather than a
-- pile of headers, and it is upstream's supported way to do it (CMakeLists.txt
-- builds the `miniaudio` library target from exactly this source).
--
-- CONSEQUENCE FOR CONSUMERS: do NOT also define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION in your
-- own code. The implementation is already compiled into this package's lib, and
-- defining the macro a second time gives you every miniaudio symbol twice --
-- a LINK error, not a compile error, so it surfaces late. Just
-- `#include <miniaudio.h>` and link.
--
-- SYSTEM LIBRARIES: miniaudio dlopen()s its backends rather than linking them,
-- which is why the Linux link line is `-ldl -lpthread -lm` and NOT -lasound /
-- -lpulse -- ALSA and PulseAudio are resolved at runtime if present, so the
-- package builds on a machine that has neither. (CMakeLists.txt: THREADS,
-- ${CMAKE_DL_LIBS}, m.)
