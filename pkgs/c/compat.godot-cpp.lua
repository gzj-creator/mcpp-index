-- compat.godot-cpp -- godot-cpp (the C++ bindings for Godot's GDExtension API)
-- as an ordinary mcpp source package: `#include <godot_cpp/...>` works out of
-- the box, no SCons, no CMake and no Python on the consumer side.
--
-- Why the download is NOT the upstream tag archive
--   godot-cpp is only half a source tree. The other half -- ~1000 engine
--   classes and every builtin Variant type, i.e. gen/include + gen/src -- is
--   produced by upstream's own binding_generator.py from
--   gdextension/extension_api.json, and no upstream tag archive or release
--   carries it. A package that ran that generator at install time would make
--   a Python toolchain a hard runtime dependency of every consumer, on every
--   platform, which is exactly what this index avoids elsewhere (the frozen
--   configure snapshots in compat.ffmpeg / the opencv module package).
--
--   So the generator runs ONCE, offline, and the result is published as an
--   immutable mirror archive: upstream's tree byte-for-byte (the repack
--   verifies this and refuses otherwise) plus the gen/ tree that upstream's
--   unmodified binding_generator.py emitted for it. Recipe and verification
--   live in tools/godot-cpp/repack.sh; upstream's own archive for
--   godot-4.5-stable hashes to
--   ac78539c0042554c494ea419549d2de88758d448721aeb0e5d41129aa87e339c.
--
--   Bindings are generated for the default configuration -- 64-bit,
--   precision=single, template_get_node on -- which is what `scons` and
--   `cmake` give you by default. A double-precision build needs a different
--   gen/ tree, so it cannot be a feature over this archive; it would be a
--   second version/package.
--
-- Defines
--   GDEXTENSION is upstream's PUBLIC compile definition (cmake sets it on the
--   godot-cpp target's INTERFACE), so it rides on a default feature: the lib
--   and every consumer TU must agree. The layout-affecting ones are left
--   undefined on both sides, which is upstream's release default:
--   DEBUG_ENABLED / DEV_ENABLED (extra checks), HOT_RELOAD_ENABLED (changes
--   the Wrapped layout) and REAL_T_IS_DOUBLE (needs the double-precision
--   gen/ tree above). They are deliberately NOT features: each would re-key
--   the store into a second full ~1000-TU build of the same library.
--
-- Consuming
--   compat.godot-cpp is the plain-header form. `import godot_cpp;` is the
--   module package godotengine.godot-cpp (mcpplibs/godot-cpp-m), which builds
--   on top of this one.
