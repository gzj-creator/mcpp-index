-- compat.re2 — RE2, Google's linear-time regular expression engine.
--
-- Shape A (C++ source compat): no configure step, no code generation, no
-- submodules, and platform handling is entirely in-source, so one source list
-- and one sha256 cover linux/macosx/windows.
--
-- WHY THIS VERSION. `2022-04-01` is an upstream RE2 release tag, and it is the
-- one gRPC 1.83.0 pins (its third_party/re2 submodule is commit 0c5616d ==
-- tag 2022-04-01). That pin is the point: gRPC's xds matchers
-- (src/core/util/matchers.h, src/core/xds/grpc/xds_route_config*) are written
-- against this API. RE2 switched its own string type from re2::StringPiece to
-- absl::string_view in the 2023 releases and took on an Abseil dependency
-- there, so a newer RE2 is not a drop-in for this consumer. Newer releases can
-- be added as ADDITIONAL versions of this same descriptor when something wants
-- them — the index carries multi-version packages already (compat.catch2).
--
-- The GitHub tag archive is used rather than a release asset because upstream
-- publishes no assets for this tag; the archive is self-contained (RE2 has no
-- submodules) and its digest was verified stable across two downloads.
