-- Form A descriptor: the godot-cpp module package ships its own mcpp.toml.
-- mcpp's default lookup finds <verdir>/*/mcpp.toml inside the GitHub source
-- tarball wrap.
--
-- The package is the thin C++23 module layer over godot-cpp's unchanged C++
-- API: `import godot_cpp;` re-exports the whole public `godot` namespace, so
-- code that used to open with a stack of `#include <godot_cpp/...>` opens with
-- one import and is otherwise the same. godot-cpp's sources and its
-- pre-generated GDExtension bindings arrive through the package's own
-- compat.godot-cpp dependency (1022-TU source build -- see
-- pkgs/c/compat.godot-cpp.lua).
--
-- Module name: ONE segment, `godot_cpp`, matching the library and the
-- `#include <godot_cpp/...>` root users already type. The dotted spelling is
-- reserved here for packages that expose several submodules (opencv.cv,
-- ffmpeg.av); this one has a single interface unit.
--
-- What the module cannot carry: MACROS. GDCLASS, GDREGISTER_CLASS,
-- GDVIRTUAL_*, D_METHOD, memnew/memdelete and the ERR_* family are
-- preprocessor constructs, and GDExtension code is written in them. The
-- package ships `<godot-cpp-m/macros.h>` for exactly that, to be included
-- next to the import; godot-cpp's headers sit in the module's global module
-- fragment, so the two spellings denote the same entities and mixing them is
-- well-formed. The package's own tests cover both shapes.
--
-- Also not re-exported (upstream's shape, not a wrapper choice): the internal
-- container templates HashMap/HashSet and their default hashers. Their inline
-- bodies reach `hash_murmur3_one_float/double`, which are `static` AND declare
-- an unnamed union -- and exposing a TU-local TYPE from a module interface is
-- a hard error, not the -Wexpose-global-module-tu-local warning. Extension
-- code uses Dictionary/Array/TypedArray; the headers still have the rest.
--
-- The version TRACKS UPSTREAM rather than counting the wrapper's own
-- iterations: 4.5.0 is the godot-cpp release it wraps, and the version
-- compat.godot-cpp carries, so the version tells a consumer the one thing
-- that matters -- which Godot they are targeting.
--
-- The name is `godot-cpp-m`, NOT `godot-cpp`, and that is load-bearing rather
-- than cosmetic. This package and its own compat.godot-cpp dependency are
-- always resolved together, and mcpp's installed-package lookup matches on
-- (name, version) WITHOUT the namespace: with both named `godot-cpp` at the
-- same version -- which "the version tracks upstream" guarantees -- resolving
-- this one lands on compat's unpacked directory and fails with "no mcpp.toml
-- at <verdir>/*/mcpp.toml". Reproducible with a namespace unrelated to either
-- package: leave a single <anything>-x-godot-cpp/4.5.0 in the store and the
-- resolution goes to it; remove it and the same descriptor installs fine. The
-- store DIRECTORIES are namespaced (ns-x-name) -- the lookup is not. Distinct
-- short names sidestep it, keep the version tracking upstream, and `-m`
-- matches the repository name. `import godot_cpp;` is unaffected.
--
-- CN tag is `v4.5.0-m`: the gitcode mirror repo is shared with the
-- compat.godot-cpp archives, which already hold the bare-version tags.
--
-- Three platforms, one OS-neutral tarball: godot-cpp is portable C++ and
-- compat.godot-cpp covers all three.
