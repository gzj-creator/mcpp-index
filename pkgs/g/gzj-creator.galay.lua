-- Form A descriptor: Galay publishes its own mcpp.toml at the archive root.
-- The manifest builds the default utils/kernel C++23 module surface and keeps
-- protocol/database/TLS components behind its upstream features.
--
-- v5.0.2 is Unix-only in the upstream manifest (Linux and macOS). Windows is
-- intentionally absent until Galay publishes a Windows-compatible manifest.
-- No mcpp-res mirror is configured locally, so the plain GLOBAL URL is the
-- documented fallback for CN consumers until a maintainer creates the mirror.
