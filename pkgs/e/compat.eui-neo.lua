-- compat.eui-neo — EUI-NEO, a declarative retained-mode C++17 UI framework.
--
-- Header-compat shape (Form B, `import_std = false`): the ~20 core TUs are
-- compiled into one lib and the public headers are exposed through
-- `include_dirs`, so a consumer writes `#include <eui_neo.h>`. The C++23
-- module surface (`import eui;`) is deliberately NOT modelled here — upstream
-- ships no module interface units, and wrapping 40+ component headers is a
-- separate piece of work.
--
-- Upstream vendors its third-party libraries under `3rd/` (freetype, glfw,
-- libpng, zlib, glad, tray, yyjson, md4c). NONE of those are built here: each
-- one already exists in this index as its own `compat.*` package at the same
-- upstream version, and building them once for the whole ecosystem is the
-- point of having them. `3rd/` is still on the include path because three
-- genuinely vendored single-file headers live at its root (stb_image,
-- nanosvg, nanosvgrast) and the sources include them as `"3rd/stb_image.h"`.
--
-- The build recipe below tracks upstream `CMakeLists.txt` (v0.5.3): CORE_SOURCES
-- plus the OpenGL backend and, for the glfw window backend, `ime_bridge.c`.
--
-- All `mcpp` paths are GLOBS relative to the verdir; the leading `*/` absorbs
-- the GitHub tarball's `EUI-NEO-0.5.3/` wrap layer.
